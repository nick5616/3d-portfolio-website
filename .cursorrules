# Terminal Usage Rules

## Terminal Management

-   **ALWAYS close terminals after use** - use `is_background: false` and ensure the command completes
-   **Run commands automatically when needed** - don't wait for user approval
-   **Only use terminals when necessary** for debugging, testing, or when the user requests it
-   **If you must open a terminal, close it immediately after the task is complete**

## When to Use Terminals

-   When the user explicitly asks for terminal commands
-   For essential debugging that cannot be done through file inspection
-   When the user specifically requests running a development server
-   For testing commands or checking if something works
-   For running build commands, installs, or other necessary development tasks

## When NOT to Use Terminals

-   For general code analysis (use search tools instead)
-   For file searching (use the search tools instead)
-   For routine development tasks that don't require execution

## Best Practices

-   Always close terminals immediately after use
-   Use `is_background: false` for commands that should complete
-   Run commands automatically without waiting for approval
-   Explain why a terminal is necessary before opening it
