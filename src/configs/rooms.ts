        // programming late into the night, having done the same thing 9-5. I truly love what I do, and that includes more than software
        // engineering. I love to make art, and things in general. And so, I try to experiment with any medium I can reasonably get my
        // hands on. This year, 2025, I plan on trying/reinvigorating the following media (no order):
        // 1. Realism with pencil
        // 2. Animation-style rendering in digital art
        // 3. Instrumental music
        // 4. Poetry
        // 5. Learning to sing, and writing a song
        // 6. Woodworking (with an adult brain)
        // 7. Stick and poke tattooing
        // 8. Machine tattooing

        // inspiration to be my best, so that I may be worth being her one and only. I love you, Alicia.
